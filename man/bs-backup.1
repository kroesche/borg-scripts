.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.P
.B bs-backup
is a script to assist with making backups using 'borg'. It uses the concept of
"backup sets" which are named configurations. Each backup set can have its own
backup paths and exclusions.
.P
The first form is used to make a backup of the specified backup set.
.P
The second form tests the backup by performing a dry-run. The backup results
are printed to the console but no backup is actually performed. This can be
used to test a backup and make sure it does what is intended.
.P
The third form is used to list all the defined backup sets.
.P
A backup set is defined in a configuration file, named like
"bs\-set\-example.cfg". In this example the name of the backup set is
"example". The configuration file has several variables defined to configure
the paths that will be backed up as well as paths to exclude. Look in the
example file comments for more details about what needs to go in this file.
